This post will contain the current/on going changes to my Linux configurations. This includes everything from software, DE(Desktop enviornments), system management, and bash scripts

My current git configurations cant be found at:
https://github.com/void4121/linux-customization

**Overview:**

1 - First things first we need Arch installed. With the help of my Youtube degree I was able to install arch via archinstall script. Its easy for beginners although most in the linux community recommend installing from scratch this was my lazy/quick attempt to get it running

side note: During the installation process I struggled alot with graphics card drivers and getting the display to function which I will mention troubleshooting steps later

2 - Post install I work on configuring Yay and using the AUR package manager as most of my tools and software are derived from yay.



Step 1:
I hope to soon have an easy and readily available Archinstall script up and running but for now here are my steps

- First get the latest Arch image flashed onto a flash drive:
https://archlinux.org/download/

- Install settings: This varies as in my experience I had different setups for my Desktop (custom built wiht a 3060 which factors in later) and Laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad E14)
