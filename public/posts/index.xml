            <description>Welcome to my first post on my new site! For context this is the second site that I have had live. The previous site was hosted on git but was forked from an unowned repo. This site is still hosted on git but is created by HUGO a static site generator which I will discuss in a seperate blog.
This site will contain numerous things I work on. School and personal projects.</description>
